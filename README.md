# Web API Light

There is a my custom template for .Net Core WebAPI solution. I want to create something that I could use for quick start.

## Acknowledgments

Well... I want to thank all of this people. I started this project just like an example of Web API, but step-by-step I improve and extend architecture after new info.

## Components

* .WebAPI services - Incoming point
    * [.Net Core WebAPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio) - Basic framework
    * [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) - It's a very simple in use and informative instrument for documentation your API
* Business services - Separate class library with example of some "business" logic. In this case I implement next techniques:
    * [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) - for CQRS 
    * [Specification](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/the-specification-pattern-in-c-sharp/) - for Q in CQRS
    * [FluentValidation](https://fluentvalidation.net/) - basically.. for validation.
* DataAccess
    * [Ef Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) - ORM
    * [Npgsql](https://www.npgsql.org/) - additional package for support PostgreSQL
* NotificationWorker - example of .Net Core Worker template in action. There is only recieving message from bus and log it.
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) as bus for connect API and Worker
* [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq) - support structure logging with [Serilog](https://serilog.net/)
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for analytics
* And some tests of course
